The peer call uses the host's configured model with maximum
effort/depth. Skills do **not** pass `--model` or `--effort` flags —
each host's config file (`~/.codex/config.toml`,
`~/.claude/settings.json`, etc.) is the single source of truth.

`Ensemble Affinity` (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH) is retained as a Task Profile
axis (records context about the task) but does **not** gate dispatch.
