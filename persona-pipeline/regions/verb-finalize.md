The phase note this step records — fill in every `<…>`:

```markdown
### Ensemble launched: {{launched}} at <iso-utc>

### Ensemble synthesis: {{synthesis}} verdict=<agreed|concerns|conflict>

<AGREED / LOCAL-ONLY / PEER-ONLY / CONFLICT breakdown>

{{artifact}}

### Active next-action proposal

- selected_next:         <verb | owner decision>
- rejected_alternatives: <1-2 alternatives, each + one-line why-not>
- rationale:             <why best — {{rationale_gate}}>
- evidence_pointers:     <{{evidence_pointers}} — pointers only>
- confidence:            <HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW>
- next_command:          <exact next step: /{{persona}}:<verb> … or ${{persona}}:<verb> for a verb>
```

Then run the block with the filled-in note in place of its placeholder line,
between the two `PHASE_NOTE` lines. The quoted heredoc hands the note to
`state.mjs` as written: no quote, `$`, backtick or backslash in it is read by
the shell. The first line that reads `PHASE_NOTE` alone ends the note, and
the shell runs every line after it as a command, so when the note itself holds
such a line, replace both `PHASE_NOTE` delimiters with a word no line of the
note consists of.

```bash
ROOT_OVERRIDE="$(printenv {{root_env}} || true)"

# ADR-0029 §1 / completion-output contract §2 — set --next-action (the
# append above and this terminal write) to the COMPACT form of the
# proposal above (selected_next + one-line why + next_command) so the
# durable state and the code-emitted completion footer agree with the
# Active Next-Action Proposal. The value shown is the typical-case
# default; override it when the verb's result selects a different next
# step (e.g. the owner publish/commit step).
# ADR-0017 §sub-decision 5 — atomic terminal write.
# ARCHIVE TIMING — on Claude the Stop hook fires at EVERY turn end, so the
# archive gates are evaluated at the end of THIS turn, not at session close;
# if a gate fails the workflow stays marked and a later Stop re-evaluates it.
# Clearing the marker with `--terminal-marker false` works only before that
# Stop fires, needs set-terminal's full flag set (--workflow-path, --host,
# --terminal-phase), and does not restore the previous phase or next_action.
# On Codex the Stop hook runs only once the operator has trusted the plugin
# hooks (`/hooks`), so evaluation waits for that. Full contract:
# core/skills/_shared/references/session-handoff.md § Archive timing.
