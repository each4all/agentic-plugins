A codex peer answers from a snapshot of the checkout, removed when the
run ends (C96): a file it writes is discarded with it. Ask it for an
answer, not for files.

The prompt reaches the runner as a file you write, never in the block: in
shell source a quote, `$`, backtick or line of it would be read as code, and
so would a `--prompt-file` path (ADR-0059, amendment of 2026-10-10). Before
the block:

1. Create a private directory for it, and note the path it prints:

   ```bash
   mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/agentic-text.XXXXXX"
   ```

2. With your file-writing tool, not the shell, write the prompt there as
   `prompt.xml`: the `--prompt-text`, or the text of the `--prompt-file`,
   which you read with your file-reading tool. Write it as given, or as the
   privacy gate leaves it where the runbook has one. Nothing deletes it.

Then run the block with `TEXT_DIR` set to that directory and `PEER` to the
`--peer` value. A `prompt.xml` that is missing or blank stops it before the
dispatch. Keep the directory: the block writes the run id there before it
dispatches, `prompt.xml.run-id`, and the runner its result,
`prompt.xml.run.json`, and its stderr, `prompt.xml.err`; the `[Peer]` note
step reads the run from the result.
