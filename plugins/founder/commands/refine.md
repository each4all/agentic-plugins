# Founder · Refine

$ARGUMENTS

Maintain one progress entry per phase and advance its status as you go — use the host's task-tracking tools when the session exposes them, and keep an inline checklist when it does not. The peer ensemble
runs automatically (Refine-verify point type) — never ask the user
whether to invoke the peer, and never direct them to run companion CLIs
manually. When the companions plugin or peer CLI is unavailable, the
ensemble degrades silently to local-only.

<!-- pipeline:begin plugin-root -->
Plugin root: each shell block below opens by setting `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` —
from `AGENTIC_FOUNDER_ROOT` when that is set, else from the plugin path
Claude Code writes into this command when it loads it, else from the newest
version in the plugin cache. Keep those opening lines when you run a block: a
shell variable does not outlive a Bash call.
<!-- pipeline:end plugin-root -->

> **founder is not an orchestrator dispatch target** (ADR-0036 Non-Goal
> 3): this command does NOT read `AGENTIC_PARENT_WORKFLOW` /
> `AGENTIC_ORIGINATING_SUBTASK`, and founder `state.mjs create` does not
> accept parent-linkage flags. founder workflows are user-invoked and
> branch-anchored only.

In the block, replace `<the original request described above>` with a
one-line genericized refine target; `AGENTIC_TOPIC` takes its place when it is set.

<!-- pipeline:end refine-resume -->

## Phase 1 — Execute refine

Follow the refine skill's command-invoked mode at
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/core/skills/refine/SKILL.md`. Refine is single-mode (no
`--profile` argument). Business context flows through the Business Task
Profile per `core/skills/_shared/references/orchestration.md`.

Refine applies critique findings or feedback to the business artifact and
verifies the revision holds together. The upstream contract is:
`critique` (or `investigate --profile=root-cause` for an
underperformance) → `decide` (if 2+ viable remediation directions) →
`refine`. **Verify means internal consistency, not "run tests"**: confirm
the revised sections still reconcile (unit-economics ↔ go-to-market ↔
pricing ↔ milestones), confirm the change did not open a new veto-gate
exposure (규제노출 / 안전리스크), and confirm still-unverified numbers keep
their `[to be validated]` markers. When the remediation involves 2+
viable directions, route through `/founder:decide` rather than choosing
silently.

### Privacy gate (before any external call)

<!-- pipeline:begin refine-privacy-gate -->
PRIVACY GATE: proprietary venture concepts, interview/customer data, and unpublished business material
pass an explicit privacy gate before BOTH web search AND peer-host dispatch.
Genericize the revision before the peer prompt; the pre-genericization value MUST never leave the local host.
See `core/skills/investigate/references/business-brief-spec.md` § Privacy Gate.
<!-- pipeline:end refine-privacy-gate -->

<!-- pipeline:begin refine-privacy-no-image -->
No dispatch passes `--image`: the companion peer path has no image channel, so
an image never reaches the peer as bytes.
<!-- pipeline:end refine-privacy-no-image -->

### Ensemble dispatch (Refine-verify point type)

Build the Refine-verify prompt per
`core/skills/_shared/references/ensemble-protocol.md` §Refine-verify (the peer
receives the **genericized** before→after of the changed sections and
verifies the revision resolves the finding without introducing a new
inconsistency or a new gate exposure), write it to a tempfile, and
dispatch in the background. The privacy gate must have passed first.

<!-- pipeline:begin refine-dispatch -->
```bash
ROOT_OVERRIDE="$(printenv 'AGENTIC_FOUNDER_ROOT' || true)"
CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="${ROOT_OVERRIDE:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}"
[ -n "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT" ] || CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="$(find ~/.claude/plugins/cache/agentic-plugins/'founder' -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d 2>/dev/null | grep -E '/(0|[1-9][0-9]*)\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)(\+[0-9A-Za-z-]+(\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)*)?$' | sort -V | tail -1)"
ENSEMBLE_TYPE='refine-verify'
PROMPT_FILE="$(mktemp -t 'founder'-'refine'-prompt.XXXXXX).xml"
# ADR-0017 §sub-decision 4 — stable run-id BEFORE dispatch.
RUN_ID="${ENSEMBLE_TYPE}-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)-$(printf '%06x' $((RANDOM*RANDOM & 0xffffff)))"
# ... LLM writes the prompt to $PROMPT_FILE (the privacy gate above must have
#     passed; the prompt carries only genericized text) ...
# Run this block as a host background task (on Claude, the Bash tool's
# run_in_background), never with a trailing `&`: the host tracks the runner
# and notifies you when it exits, where a shell `&` would detach it from both.
node "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/peer-runner.mjs" run \
  --repo-root "$REPO_ROOT" --kind ensemble \
  --peer codex --prompt-file "$PROMPT_FILE" --output-format json \
  --workflow-path "$ACTIVE" --phase 'refine' \
  --host "${AGENTIC_HOST:-claude}" --cwd "$REPO_ROOT" \
  --ensemble-type "$ENSEMBLE_TYPE" --run-id "$RUN_ID" \
  > "$PROMPT_FILE.run.json" 2> "$PROMPT_FILE.err"
```
<!-- pipeline:end refine-dispatch -->

Use `run_in_background: true` on the Bash tool. `peer-runner.mjs run`
records the matching `pending_ensemble` row before spawning the companion
and writes raw peer output under the hidden peer-run ledger. Synthesize
per AGREED / LOCAL-ONLY / PEER-ONLY / CONFLICT. A peer-flagged regression
(new inconsistency / new gate exposure) pauses the refine for user
direction.

Graceful degradation: companion missing or exit code 3
(`peer_cli_not_found` / `peer_unauthenticated` / `peer_invocation_error`)
→ proceed local-only and record "### Ensemble degraded:" in the body.

---

<!-- pipeline:begin refine-finalize-heading -->
## Phase 2 — State finalize
<!-- pipeline:end refine-finalize-heading -->

<!-- pipeline:begin refine-finalize -->
The phase note this step records — fill in every `<…>`. When no run launched
(the privacy gate kept the verb local-only, so no dispatch ran; a run whose
companion is missing did launch, and settles `failed`), its first heading reads
`### Ensemble skipped: refine (privacy gate)` instead, and the synthesis
is local-only:

```markdown
### Ensemble launched: refine at <iso-utc>

### Ensemble synthesis: refine verdict=<resolved|concerns|regression|conflict>

<AGREED / LOCAL-ONLY / PEER-ONLY / CONFLICT breakdown>

### Refinement summary

- Applied: <N findings / 1 revision>
- Verified: <downstream sections reconcile; gate exposure unchanged;
  [to be validated] markers intact>
- Deferred: <items not addressed and why>

### Active next-action proposal

(per `core/skills/_shared/references/entry-routing-contract.md` § Active Next-Action Proposal — derived from this artifact, not a fixed table)
- selected_next:         <verb | commit | done | owner decision>
- rejected_alternatives: <1-2 alternatives, each + one-line why-not>
- rationale:             <why best — 본질/근본 (essence/foundation) + consistency/gate check>
- evidence_pointers:     <revised sections / artifact path — pointers only>
- confidence:            <HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW>
- next_command:          <exact next step: /founder:<verb> … or $founder:<verb> for a verb; the owner's save and commit for commit; none for done; the owner's decision otherwise>
```

Then run the block with the filled-in note in place of its placeholder line,
between the two `PHASE_NOTE` lines. The quoted heredoc hands the note to
`state.mjs` as written: no quote, `$`, backtick or backslash in it is read by
the shell. The first line that reads `PHASE_NOTE` alone ends the note, and
the shell runs every line after it as a command, so when the note itself holds
such a line, replace both `PHASE_NOTE` delimiters with a word no line of the
note consists of.

Set `RUN_ID` to the run id the dispatch generated, empty when no run launched,
and `VERDICT` and `SUMMARY` to the synthesis's verdict and a one-line résumé
of its breakdown. `peer-runner.mjs settle` decides from the run ledger what the
workflow records, not from these values alone: a run that never launched
records nothing; a run that launched and failed, was cancelled or was
abandoned records verdict `failed` with the ledger's `error_kind`; a run that
completed records the synthesis verdict, or `degraded` when its answer was
empty or unreadable. An answer that parses to nothing usable, only structural
shell, reads to `settle` like any other, so set `VERDICT` to `degraded` then.
It refuses, and the block stops before the last write, while a run is still
live (collect it first) or when an empty `RUN_ID` would hide a run that
launched (set it to that run's id).

The last write, `finish-verb`, records the proposal's next step in closed-enum
form: `--next-step-kind` `verb` (with `--next-step-verb`), `commit` (the owner
saves and commits the artifact; founder runs no commit itself) or `done`,
each closing the workflow `summary-complete`. End instead with an owner gate
when the owner must judge, with the judgment under the gate's heading in the
note:

- `recurring-finding` (heading `### Recurring finding`, anchor
  `recurring-finding`): a finding an earlier refine pass on this workflow
  already addressed survives verification again; fixing it again is the
  owner's call, and § Owner decision below resolves it.
- `scope-routing` (heading `### Routing recommendation`, anchor
  `routing-recommendation`): the request does not belong in this verb or
  workflow; the owner picks the route, then clears the gate.

The owner-decision form below records the gate with the next step in one
write and leaves the workflow open, not terminal, until the owner resolves it.

## Multi-axis lens at a 2+-branch point (ADR-0029 §2)

If refine surfaces a **genuine 2+-branch decision point** — two viable
remediation directions, or two ways to close the same gap — surface a
**compact multi-axis lens** across the decisive business axes (시장성 /
단위경제) + the veto gates, instead of a flat list, reading
`core/skills/decide/references/decision-axes.yml` (the
`scripts/decide-registry.mjs resolve --size=minor` compact 4-axis set).
Bounded: only at a genuine 2+-branch point, never the full matrix for a
trivial reversible step. A weightier fork should route to
`/founder:decide`.

---

<!-- pipeline:begin refine-owner-decision -->
## Owner decision (recurring-finding)

The `recurring-finding` gate is resolved by the owner's decision (ADR-0063 Q2,
ported by ADR-0066 Decision 9), in either of two ways:

- **In this session**, right after the refine stopped on it.
- **Later**, when Phase 0's preflight reports a pending `recurring-finding`
  gate (an earlier session stopped on it): present the finding recorded at the
  gate's pointer, the latest `Recurring finding` note.

Ask the owner: fix it now, or defer it. The clear records the owner's decision
(`--resolution`, written in place of the placeholder line between the two
`OWNER_RESOLUTION` lines) and the next step it implies in one write, so the
next step never becomes runnable without the decision behind it, and a failure
never leaves the gate's `owner-decision` behind. Inside a `/founder:start`
lifecycle the Defer block clears the gate and stops there: resume the
lifecycle, which makes its one terminal write.

**Fix now.** Clear the gate with this refine as the next step, then run the
phases above on that finding, as usual:

```bash
ROOT_OVERRIDE="$(printenv 'AGENTIC_FOUNDER_ROOT' || true)"
CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="${ROOT_OVERRIDE:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}"
[ -n "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT" ] || CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="$(find ~/.claude/plugins/cache/agentic-plugins/'founder' -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d 2>/dev/null | grep -E '/(0|[1-9][0-9]*)\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)(\+[0-9A-Za-z-]+(\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)*)?$' | sort -V | tail -1)"

# The owner's resolution, from a quoted heredoc: no quote, $, backtick or
# backslash in it is read by the shell. An empty read stops the block.
unset RESOLUTION
IFS= read -r -d '' RESOLUTION <<'OWNER_RESOLUTION' || true

```

**Defer.** Clear the gate with the deferral and `commit` as the next step (the
owner saves and commits the artifact; founder runs no commit itself), then
end the verb:

```bash

## Completion

Output the refinement summary (applied / verified / deferred) and one of:

- `✓ Refinement complete.` + the artifact revised and reconciled.
- `✓ Refine paused (regression flagged).` — when the peer or the
  consistency check surfaced a new inconsistency or gate exposure that
  warrants user input before proceeding.
- `✓ Refine stopped for the owner (recurring finding).` — a finding an
  earlier refine pass already addressed survived verification again. Phase 2
  ended with the owner-decision form of `finish-verb`, which recorded the
  `recurring-finding` gate: record the owner's decision with the Owner
  decision step above.

Then emit an **Active Next-Action Proposal** (the inline shape in
`core/skills/refine/SKILL.md` § Completion): typical `selected_next` is
`/founder:critique` to confirm the revision with another review pass — or
"the plan is sound, proceed" when the change was small and reconciles. Do
not end with a hardcoded "next: X".

Always include the workflow path:

```
Workflow: <absolute path to workflow .md file>
```

<!-- pipeline:begin refine-completion-footer -->
The runtime completion footer is **code-emitted** on this verb's terminal
path (ADR-0039, enabled for founder by ADR-0043): the terminal write
(`state.mjs finish-verb`, which takes `set-terminal`'s path) fires the
ADR-0031 session-handoff sidecar, which shells out
to the runtime `footer.mjs` and prints the rendered footer — context
state, completion state (founder's manually-published mapping surfaces
`publish-needed` when only the owner's save/commit remains) + state-derived
next action, workflow id/path, artifact pointers, recommended next work,
and the continue-vs-fresh session-handoff — on that command's **stderr**.
Do **not** hand-compose a second footer; surface the one the terminal
command already emitted. The footer is advisory + pointer-only and
fail-closed (a missing/too-old runtime emits nothing, and the SessionStart
backstop still re-surfaces the handoff); it never mutates host session
context. Detached HEAD never auto-recommends a fresh session (ADR-0018
§sub-2; the branch-based preflight is what reports "no active branch
context" — the path-targeted terminal sidecar still renders normally).
Wiring details:
`core/skills/_shared/references/session-handoff.md`.
