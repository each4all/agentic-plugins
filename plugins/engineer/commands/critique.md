# Engineer · Critique

$ARGUMENTS

Maintain one progress entry per phase and advance its status as you go — use the host's task-tracking tools when the session exposes them, and keep an inline checklist when it does not. The peer ensemble
runs automatically per
`core/skills/_shared/references/ensemble-protocol.md` — Review point type
for the default profile, Adversarial-scan for the `full-codebase`
profile. Never ask the user whether to invoke the peer.

<!-- pipeline:begin plugin-root -->
Plugin root: each shell block below opens by setting `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` —
from `AGENTIC_ENGINEER_ROOT` when that is set, else from the plugin path
Claude Code writes into this command when it loads it, else from the newest
version in the plugin cache. Keep those opening lines when you run a block: a
shell variable does not outlive a Bash call.
<!-- pipeline:end plugin-root -->

A verb-level sugar alias `/engineer:audit` exists per ADR-0010 §3,
expanding to `/engineer:critique --profile=full-codebase`. The
canonical command is `/engineer:critique`.

## Phase 1 — Execute critique

Follow the critique skill's command-invoked mode at
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/core/skills/critique/SKILL.md`. Profiles:

- (default) — standard parallel review of a recent change set
  (working tree or specific commit).
- `full-codebase` — adversarial audit of an entire area or codebase,
  with optional sub-focus (`security`, `performance`,
  `code-quality`, `debt`, `full`).

Profile selection: `--profile=<name>[:<sub-profile>]` on the command,
else inferred. Missing profile → default (recent diff). Unknown
profile → fallback to default with one-line warning.

### Ensemble dispatch — Review (default) or Adversarial-scan (full-codebase)

Build the prompt per the matching ensemble-protocol section:
- default profile → `core/skills/_shared/references/ensemble-protocol.md`
  § Review
- `full-codebase` → § Adversarial-scan (with the sub-focus narrowing)

The block dispatches `review`, the default profile's point type: for
`--profile=full-codebase`, with or without a sub-focus, set
`ENSEMBLE_TYPE='adversarial-scan'` in it before running it, and build the
prompt from § Adversarial-scan.

Run this block **as a host background task** — on Claude, the Bash tool's
`run_in_background` — never with a trailing `&`: the host then tracks the
task and notifies you when the runner exits (ADR-0063 D5; a shell `&` would
detach the runner where neither you nor an autopilot host can wait for it).

<!-- pipeline:begin critique-dispatch -->
```bash
ROOT_OVERRIDE="$(printenv 'AGENTIC_ENGINEER_ROOT' || true)"
CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="${ROOT_OVERRIDE:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}"
[ -n "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT" ] || CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="$(find ~/.claude/plugins/cache/agentic-plugins/'engineer' -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d 2>/dev/null | grep -E '/(0|[1-9][0-9]*)\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)(\+[0-9A-Za-z-]+(\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)*)?$' | sort -V | tail -1)"
ENSEMBLE_TYPE='review'
PROMPT_FILE="$(mktemp -t 'engineer'-'critique'-prompt.XXXXXX).xml"
# ADR-0017 §sub-decision 4 — stable run-id BEFORE dispatch.
RUN_ID="${ENSEMBLE_TYPE}-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)-$(printf '%06x' $((RANDOM*RANDOM & 0xffffff)))"
# ... LLM writes the prompt to $PROMPT_FILE (where this runbook has a privacy
#     gate above, it must have passed, and the prompt carries only genericized
#     text) ...
# Run this block as a host background task (on Claude, the Bash tool's
# run_in_background), never with a trailing `&`: the host tracks the runner
# and notifies you when it exits, where a shell `&` would detach it from both.
node "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/peer-runner.mjs" run \
  --repo-root "$REPO_ROOT" --kind ensemble \
  --peer codex --prompt-file "$PROMPT_FILE" --output-format json \
  --workflow-path "$ACTIVE" --phase 'critique' \
  --host "${AGENTIC_HOST:-claude}" --cwd "$REPO_ROOT" \
  --ensemble-type "$ENSEMBLE_TYPE" --run-id "$RUN_ID" \
  > "$PROMPT_FILE.run.json" 2> "$PROMPT_FILE.err"
```
<!-- pipeline:end critique-dispatch -->

Local agents (orchestrator side): default profile spawns review-style
agents (correctness, conventions, simplicity, security, etc.) per
`core/skills/_shared/references/agent-taxonomy.md`. `full-codebase` spawns
adversarial-mindset agents.

`peer-runner.mjs run` records the matching `pending_ensemble` row
before spawning the companion and writes raw peer output under the
hidden peer-run ledger; the background command's stdout is the small
runner JSON result (`envelope_path`, `stdout_path`, `stderr_path`,
`handle_path`). Synthesize per AGREED / LOCAL-ONLY / PEER-ONLY /
CONFLICT. Findings get severity ratings (CRITICAL / MAJOR / MINOR /
SUGGESTION) per the critique SKILL's contract.

---

<!-- pipeline:begin critique-finalize-heading -->
## Phase 2 — State finalize
<!-- pipeline:end critique-finalize-heading -->

<!-- pipeline:begin critique-finalize -->
The phase note this step records — fill in every `<…>`. When no run launched
(the verb ran local-only, so no dispatch ran; a run whose
companion is missing did launch, and settles `failed`), its first heading reads
`### Ensemble skipped: critique (profile=<profile>) (local-only)` instead, and the synthesis
is local-only:

```markdown
### Ensemble launched: critique (profile=<profile>) at <iso-utc>

### Ensemble synthesis: critique (profile=<profile>) verdict=<agreed|concerns|conflict>

<AGREED / LOCAL-ONLY / PEER-ONLY / CONFLICT breakdown>

### Findings

<severity-grouped findings: CRITICAL / MAJOR / MINOR / SUGGESTION>

### Active next-action proposal

(per `core/skills/_shared/references/entry-routing-contract.md` § Active Next-Action Proposal — derived from this artifact, not a fixed table)
- selected_next:         <verb | commit | done | owner decision>
- rejected_alternatives: <1-2 alternatives, each + one-line why-not>
- rationale:             <why best — 본질/근본 (essence/foundation) + Standards/Root-Cause gate>
- evidence_pointers:     <phase notes / files / artifacts — pointers only>
- confidence:            <HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW>
- next_command:          <exact next step: /engineer:<verb> … or $engineer:<verb> for a verb; /engineer:commit for commit or done; the owner-decision action otherwise>
```

Then run the block with the filled-in note in place of its placeholder line,
between the two `PHASE_NOTE` lines. The quoted heredoc hands the note to
`state.mjs` as written: no quote, `$`, backtick or backslash in it is read by
the shell. The first line that reads `PHASE_NOTE` alone ends the note, and
the shell runs every line after it as a command, so when the note itself holds
such a line, replace both `PHASE_NOTE` delimiters with a word no line of the
note consists of.

Set `RUN_ID` to the run id the dispatch generated, empty when no run launched,
and `VERDICT` and `SUMMARY` to the synthesis's verdict and a one-line résumé
of its breakdown. `peer-runner.mjs settle` decides from the run ledger what the
workflow records, not from these values alone: a run that never launched
records nothing; a run that launched and failed, was cancelled or was
abandoned records verdict `failed` with the ledger's `error_kind`; a run that
completed records the synthesis verdict, or `degraded` when its answer was
empty or unreadable. An answer that parses to nothing usable, only structural
shell, reads to `settle` like any other, so set `VERDICT` to `degraded` then.
It refuses, and the block stops before the last write, while a run is still
live (collect it first) or when an empty `RUN_ID` would hide a run that
launched (set it to that run's id).

The last write, `finish-verb`, records the proposal's next step in closed-enum
form: `--next-step-kind` `verb` (with `--next-step-verb`), `commit`
(`/engineer:commit` commits the change, or closes the workflow when there is
none) or `done`, each closing the workflow `summary-complete`.
Under an autopilot run it records the next step only and leaves the terminal
marker for `/engineer:commit`, the only command that closes a workflow
there (`core/skills/_shared/references/autopilot-mode.md`).
End instead with an owner gate when the owner must judge, with the judgment
under the gate's heading in the note:

- `scope-routing` (heading `### Routing recommendation`, anchor
  `routing-recommendation`): the request does not belong in this verb or
  workflow; the owner picks the route, then clears the gate.
- `pr-handling` (heading `### Outward action needed`, anchor `pr-handling`):
  under an autopilot run, the task itself needs a push, a pull request or
  another outward action; interactively the user acts instead.

The owner-decision form below records the gate with the next step in one
write and leaves the workflow open, not terminal, until the owner resolves it.

## Autopilot mode (ADR-0063, Claude only)

When Phase 0's preflight printed the autopilot banner, this command follows
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/core/skills/_shared/references/autopilot-mode.md`
(the preflight prints nothing interactively, and none of this applies then):

- **Ceremony gates auto-pass.** No presentation-mode prompt (present in
  batch); proceed with the recommended option instead of asking
  "Recommended: X. Proceed?".
- **Refine carries CRITICAL and MAJOR findings only** — the default rule; the
  MINOR / SUGGESTION pick the user makes interactively is skipped.
- **The last write is Phase 2's `finish-verb`**, which records the next step
  and leaves the terminal marker unset: under autopilot only
  `/engineer:commit` closes a workflow, and `set-terminal --terminal-marker
  true` is refused.
- **Owner judgments.** Stop with the gate that names the judgment and do not
  decide it yourself: `scope-routing` when the request does not belong in this
  verb or workflow (recorded in either mode), `pr-handling` when the task
  itself needs a push, a pull request or another outward action (autopilot
  only; interactively the user acts). Record the gate with Phase 2's
  `finish-verb --next-step-kind owner-decision --owner-gate <gate>
  --owner-gate-anchor <anchor>` after a phase note under the heading the gate
  table names (`autopilot-mode.md` § Owner gates).
- **Peers.** Collect the ensemble as `ensemble-protocol.md` § Step 2 says:
  wait for the background notification; never sleep-poll. A step report
  taken while you wait is provisional: when the notification re-invokes you,
  finish the verb through `finish-verb`, then report again
  (`autopilot-mode.md` § Peer ensembles).

---

## Multi-axis lens at a 2+-branch point (ADR-0029 §2)

If executing this verb surfaces a **genuine 2+-branch decision point**
— two viable remediation directions, or two severity reads of the same
finding, or a non-neutral `selected_next` with 2+ candidates in the
proposal below — surface a **compact multi-axis lens** comparing the
branches across the resolved decisive axes (본질/근본 essence/foundation)
+ supporting axes, instead of a flat list. Resolve the sized axis set
from the shared
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/decide-registry.mjs resolve --size=<minor|standard|major>`
resolver — the single axis source of truth, not a hand-authored list —
per `core/skills/_shared/references/entry-routing-contract.md`
§ "Surfacing the multi-axis lens from a non-decide verb".

Bounded: only at a genuine 2+-branch point (not every invocation),
default `--size=minor` (compact 4-axis), escalating only for weightier
branches — never the full 9-axis matrix for a trivial reversible step.
The full mechanism + the Codex path-resolution fallback live in
the contract subsection cited above.

---

## Completion

Output the severity-grouped findings and one of:

- `✓ Critique complete.` + count by severity.
- `✓ Critique complete (no significant findings).` — when no
  CRITICAL or MAJOR surfaced. The artifact is in good shape.

Then emit the **Active Next-Action Proposal** the phase note above carries
(per `core/skills/_shared/references/entry-routing-contract.md`
§ Active Next-Action Proposal), instead of a fixed next verb.

Typical `selected_next` candidates for critique:
`/engineer:refine` to address selected findings (typically CRITICAL +
MAJOR; the user picks which MINOR / SUGGESTION items to include — under
autopilot, CRITICAL + MAJOR only, with no pick) — or
`commit` when no significant findings surfaced and the artifact is in good
shape. The routing table is the fallback only when evidence is genuinely
neutral — do not end with a hardcoded "next: X". When `selected_next` is
`engineer:decide`, also name the decision size
(`--size=minor|standard|major`) per the contract.

Always include the workflow path:

```
Workflow: <absolute path to workflow .md file>
```

<!-- pipeline:begin critique-completion-footer -->
The runtime completion footer is **code-emitted** on this verb's terminal
path (ADR-0039): the terminal write (`state.mjs finish-verb`, which takes
`set-terminal`'s path) fires the ADR-0031 session-handoff sidecar, which
shells out to the runtime `footer.mjs` and prints the rendered footer —
context state, completion state
(`blocked`, with the commit as its unblocking action, when only the commit
remains) + state-derived next action,
workflow id/path, artifact pointers, recommended next work, and the
continue-vs-fresh session-handoff — on that command's **stderr**.
Do **not** hand-compose a second footer; surface the one the terminal
command already emitted. The footer is advisory + pointer-only and
fail-closed (a missing/too-old runtime emits nothing, and the SessionStart
backstop still re-surfaces the handoff); it never mutates host session
context. On a detached HEAD the branch-based preflight reports "no active
branch context" and never recommends a fresh session (ADR-0018 §sub-2); the
path-targeted terminal sidecar renders the footer as on a branch, its
continue-vs-fresh advice included.
Under an autopilot run `finish-verb` makes no terminal write, so no footer is
printed: the driver is the handoff.
Wiring details:
`core/skills/_shared/references/session-handoff.md`.
