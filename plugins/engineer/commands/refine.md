# Engineer · Refine

$ARGUMENTS

Maintain one progress entry per phase and advance its status as you go — use the host's task-tracking tools when the session exposes them, and keep an inline checklist when it does not. The peer ensemble
runs automatically per
`core/skills/_shared/references/ensemble-protocol.md` (Refine-verify point
type) — never ask the user whether to invoke the peer. When the
companions plugin or peer CLI is unavailable, the ensemble degrades
silently to local-only.

<!-- pipeline:begin plugin-root -->
Plugin root: each shell block below opens by setting `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` —
from `AGENTIC_ENGINEER_ROOT` when that is set, else from the plugin path
Claude Code writes into this command when it loads it, else from the newest
version in the plugin cache. Keep those opening lines when you run a block: a
shell variable does not outlive a Bash call.
<!-- pipeline:end plugin-root -->

Core principle: do not modify code until the root cause is confirmed.
When refining a bug fix, the upstream contract is investigate
(root-cause profile) → decide (if 2+ fix approaches) → refine.
Skipping investigate paper-fixes symptoms.

Empty `$ACTIVE` → bootstrap a new workflow with verb=refine:

<!-- pipeline:begin refine-bootstrap -->
The request reaches `state.mjs` as a file, never in the block: in shell
source a quote, `$`, backtick or line break of it would be read as code
(ADR-0059, amendment of 2026-10-10). Before the block:

1. Create a private directory for it, and note the path it prints:

   ```bash
   mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/agentic-text.XXXXXX"
   ```

2. With your file-writing tool, not the shell, create `request.txt` in that
   directory holding a one-line scrubbed user request, ending with one newline.
   Nothing deletes it.

Then run the block with `TEXT_DIR` set to that directory; a request file left
unwritten stops it before any write. When `AGENTIC_TOPIC` is set (a dispatched
run), the block writes it to a file of its own and records that instead, and
steps 1–2 are not needed.

## Phase 1 — Execute refine

Follow the refine skill's command-invoked mode at
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/core/skills/refine/SKILL.md`. The skill applies the
fix, runs verification (tests / lint / type-check / smoke), and
confirms the change addresses the root cause without regressions.

Refine is single-mode (no `--profile` argument). Sub-discipline
context flows through the orchestrator-level Task Profile.

In command-mode (`$ACTIVE` bound), the skill's **Layer 2
commit-manifest recording** step requires
`state.mjs record-refine-file --workflow-path "$ACTIVE" --path <p>
--op edit|create` after each Write/Edit on a tracked path. See
`core/skills/refine/SKILL.md` § Layer 2 commit-manifest recording for the
full pattern (ADR-0028 §Layer-2).

### Ensemble dispatch (Refine-verify point type)

Build the Refine-verify prompt per
`core/skills/_shared/references/ensemble-protocol.md` § Refine-verify.
The peer independently verifies that the fix addresses the symptom,
checks for over-fitting, and probes for regressions.

Run this block **as a host background task** — on Claude, the Bash tool's
`run_in_background` — never with a trailing `&`: the host then tracks the
task and notifies you when the runner exits (ADR-0063 D5; a shell `&` would
detach the runner where neither you nor an autopilot host can wait for it).

<!-- pipeline:begin refine-dispatch -->
The prompt reaches the runner as a file the block never builds: it carries the
artifact and the peer's instructions, and in shell source a quote, `$`,
backtick or line of them would be read as code (ADR-0059, amendment of
2026-10-10). Before the block:

1. Create a private directory for it, and note the path it prints:

   ```bash
   mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/agentic-text.XXXXXX"
   ```

2. With your file-writing tool, not the shell, create `prompt.xml` in that
   directory holding the prompt (where this runbook has a privacy gate above,
   it must have passed, and the prompt carries only genericized text).
   Nothing deletes it.

Then run the block with `TEXT_DIR` set to that directory; a prompt left
unwritten stops it before the dispatch.

```bash
TEXT_DIR='<directory from step 1>'
ROOT_OVERRIDE="$(printenv 'AGENTIC_ENGINEER_ROOT' || true)"
CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="${ROOT_OVERRIDE:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}"
[ -n "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT" ] || CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="$(find ~/.claude/plugins/cache/agentic-plugins/'engineer' -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d 2>/dev/null | grep -E '/(0|[1-9][0-9]*)\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)(\+[0-9A-Za-z-]+(\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)*)?$' | sort -V | tail -1)"
ENSEMBLE_TYPE='refine-verify'
# The prompt the agent wrote with its file tool: the runner reads it, so no
# line of it is shell source. A prompt left unwritten stops the block here.
PROMPT_FILE="$TEXT_DIR/prompt.xml"
grep -q '[^[:space:]]' "$PROMPT_FILE" 2>/dev/null || { echo "✗ prompt.xml in TEXT_DIR ($TEXT_DIR) is missing or blank; write it with the file tool first. Nothing was dispatched." >&2; exit 1; }
# ADR-0017 §sub-decision 4 — stable run-id BEFORE dispatch.
RUN_ID="${ENSEMBLE_TYPE}-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)-$(printf '%06x' $((RANDOM*RANDOM & 0xffffff)))"
# Run this block as a host background task (on Claude, the Bash tool's
# run_in_background), never with a trailing `&`: the host tracks the runner
# and notifies you when it exits, where a shell `&` would detach it from both.
node "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/peer-runner.mjs" run \
  --repo-root "$REPO_ROOT" --kind ensemble \
  --peer codex --prompt-file "$PROMPT_FILE" --output-format json \
  --workflow-path "$ACTIVE" --phase 'refine' \
  --host "${AGENTIC_HOST:-claude}" --cwd "$REPO_ROOT" \
  --ensemble-type "$ENSEMBLE_TYPE" --run-id "$RUN_ID" \
  > "$PROMPT_FILE.run.json" 2> "$PROMPT_FILE.err"
```
<!-- pipeline:end refine-dispatch -->

`peer-runner.mjs run` records the matching `pending_ensemble` row
before spawning the companion and writes raw peer output under the
hidden peer-run ledger; the background command's stdout is the small
runner JSON result (`envelope_path`, `stdout_path`, `stderr_path`,
`handle_path`). Synthesize per AGREED / LOCAL-ONLY / PEER-ONLY /
CONFLICT. Peer-flagged regressions or over-fitting concerns block
completion until addressed.

When a finding that an earlier refine pass on this workflow already
addressed survives verification again, fixing it again is not this verb's
call (ADR-0063 D4): record a `### Recurring finding` note naming it, and end
with the `recurring-finding` gate (Phase 2's owner-decision form); the Owner
decision step below resolves it.

---

<!-- pipeline:begin refine-finalize-heading -->
## Phase 2 — State finalize
<!-- pipeline:end refine-finalize-heading -->

<!-- pipeline:begin refine-finalize -->
The phase note this step records — fill in every `<…>`. When no run launched
(the verb ran local-only, so no dispatch ran; a run whose
companion is missing did launch, and settles `failed`), its first heading reads
`### Ensemble skipped: refine (local-only)` instead, and the synthesis
is local-only:

```markdown
### Ensemble launched: refine at <iso-utc>

### Ensemble synthesis: refine verdict=<resolved|concerns|regression|conflict>

<AGREED / LOCAL-ONLY / PEER-ONLY / CONFLICT breakdown>

### Changes applied

<list of edited files with one-line summary; test/lint/type-check status>

### Verification

<test results, regression checks, root-cause confirmation>

### Active next-action proposal

(per `core/skills/_shared/references/entry-routing-contract.md` § Active Next-Action Proposal — derived from this artifact, not a fixed table)
- selected_next:         <verb | commit | done | owner decision>
- rejected_alternatives: <1-2 alternatives, each + one-line why-not>
- rationale:             <why best — 본질/근본 (essence/foundation) + Standards/Root-Cause gate>
- evidence_pointers:     <phase notes / files / artifacts — pointers only>
- confidence:            <HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW>
- next_command:          <exact next step: /engineer:<verb> … or $engineer:<verb> for a verb; /engineer:commit for commit or done; the owner-decision action otherwise>
```

The note, and the two texts the block records with it, reach the scripts as
files, never in the block: in shell source a quote, `$`, backtick or line of
them would be read as code (ADR-0059, amendment of 2026-10-10). Before the
block:

1. Create a private directory for them, and note the path it prints:

   ```bash
   mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/agentic-text.XXXXXX"
   ```

2. With your file-writing tool, not the shell, create in that directory
   `note.md`, the phase note above filled in; `summary.txt`, a one-line
   résumé of its breakdown; and `next-action.txt`, the next action the
   `append` and the last write record: the compact form of the proposal
   (selected_next + one-line why + next_command). The typical-case default
   is

   ```text
   Critique to verify, or investigate deeper if root cause is uncertain
   ```

   Write another when the verb's result selects a different next step, and
   for an owner gate below `Owner: ` and the judgment in a few words. Each
   file holds its text as written and ends with one newline, which the
   scripts remove; nothing deletes the files.

Then run the block with `TEXT_DIR` set to that directory, `RUN_ID` to the run
id the dispatch generated (empty when no run launched), and `VERDICT` to the
synthesis's verdict. A file left unwritten, blank, or not UTF-8 text stops the
block before any write.

`peer-runner.mjs settle` decides from the run ledger what the workflow
records, not from these values alone: a run that never launched records
nothing; a run that launched and failed, was cancelled or was abandoned
records verdict `failed` with the ledger's `error_kind`; a run that completed
records the synthesis verdict, or `degraded` when its answer was empty or
unreadable. An answer that parses to nothing usable, only structural
shell, reads to `settle` like any other, so set `VERDICT` to `degraded` then.
It refuses, and the block stops before the last write, while a run is still
live (collect it first) or when an empty `RUN_ID` would hide a run that
launched (set it to that run's id).

The last write, `finish-verb`, records the proposal's next step in closed-enum
form: `--next-step-kind` `verb` (with `--next-step-verb`), `commit`
(`/engineer:commit` commits the change, or closes the workflow when there is
none) or `done`, each closing the workflow `summary-complete`.
Under an autopilot run it records the next step only and leaves the terminal
marker for `/engineer:commit`, the only command that closes a workflow
there (`core/skills/_shared/references/autopilot-mode.md`).
End instead with an owner gate when the owner must judge, with the judgment
under the gate's heading in the note:

- `recurring-finding` (heading `### Recurring finding`, anchor
  `recurring-finding`): a finding an earlier refine pass on this workflow
  already addressed survives verification again; fixing it again is the
  owner's call, and § Owner decision below resolves it.
- `scope-routing` (heading `### Routing recommendation`, anchor
  `routing-recommendation`): the request does not belong in this verb or
  workflow; the owner picks the route, then clears the gate.
- `pr-handling` (heading `### Outward action needed`, anchor `pr-handling`):
  under an autopilot run, the task itself needs a push, a pull request or
  another outward action; interactively the user acts instead.

The owner-decision form below records the gate with the next step in one
write and leaves the workflow open, not terminal, until the owner resolves it.

## Autopilot mode (ADR-0063, Claude only)

When Phase 0's preflight printed the autopilot banner, this command follows
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/core/skills/_shared/references/autopilot-mode.md`
(the preflight prints nothing interactively, and none of this applies then):

- **Ceremony gates auto-pass.** No presentation-mode prompt (present in
  batch); proceed with the recommended option instead of asking
  "Recommended: X. Proceed?".
- **Never run `git commit`.** Set `--next-step-kind commit` when the artifact
  is ready; `/engineer:commit` commits it. (The driver also denies `git
  commit` on this step.)
- **A recurring finding is the owner's.** When a finding that an earlier refine
  pass on this workflow already addressed survives verification again, stop:
  end with Phase 2's owner-decision form of `finish-verb`, which records the
  `recurring-finding` gate (anchor `recurring-finding`).
- **The last write is Phase 2's `finish-verb`**, which records the next step
  and leaves the terminal marker unset: under autopilot only
  `/engineer:commit` closes a workflow, and `set-terminal --terminal-marker
  true` is refused.
- **Owner judgments.** Stop with the gate that names the judgment and do not
  decide it yourself: `scope-routing` when the request does not belong in this
  verb or workflow (recorded in either mode), `pr-handling` when the task
  itself needs a push, a pull request or another outward action (autopilot
  only; interactively the user acts). Record the gate with Phase 2's
  `finish-verb --next-step-kind owner-decision --owner-gate <gate>
  --owner-gate-anchor <anchor>` after a phase note under the heading the gate
  table names (`autopilot-mode.md` § Owner gates).
- **Peers.** Collect the ensemble as `ensemble-protocol.md` § Step 2 says:
  wait for the background notification; never sleep-poll. A step report
  taken while you wait is provisional: when the notification re-invokes you,
  finish the verb through `finish-verb`, then report again
  (`autopilot-mode.md` § Peer ensembles).

---

<!-- pipeline:begin refine-owner-decision -->
## Owner decision (recurring-finding)

The `recurring-finding` gate is resolved by the owner's decision (ADR-0063
Q2), in either of two ways:

- **In this session**, right after the refine stopped on it.
- **Later**, when Phase 0's preflight reports a pending `recurring-finding`
  gate (an autopilot run, or an earlier session, stopped on it): present the
  finding recorded at the gate's pointer, the latest `Recurring finding` note.

Ask the owner: fix it now, or defer it. The clear records the owner's decision
(`--resolution-file`, the file below) and the next step it implies in one
write, so the
next step never becomes runnable without the decision behind it, and a failure
never leaves the gate's `owner-decision` behind; the same write replaces the
gate's next action. Inside a `/engineer:start` lifecycle both blocks clear
the gate and stop there: resume the lifecycle, which fixes the finding in its
refine phase or continues at its terminal step, and makes its one terminal
write.

The owner's decision reaches `state.mjs` as a file, never in a block: in
shell source a quote, `$`, backtick or line of it would be read as code
(ADR-0059, amendment of 2026-10-10). Before either block:

1. Create a private directory for it, and note the path it prints:

   ```bash
   mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/agentic-text.XXXXXX"
   ```

2. With your file-writing tool, not the shell, create `resolution.txt` in
   that directory, ending with one newline: for Fix now, `Owner decision: fix
   the finding now` with what the owner added; for Defer, `Owner decision:
   defer the finding` with the reason and where it is tracked. Nothing
   deletes it.

Then run the block with `TEXT_DIR` set to that directory; a resolution left
unwritten stops it before any write.

**Fix now.** Clear the gate with this refine as the next step, then run the
phases above on that finding, as usual (inside a `/engineer:start`
lifecycle, resume the lifecycle instead):

```bash
TEXT_DIR='<directory from step 1>'
ROOT_OVERRIDE="$(printenv 'AGENTIC_ENGINEER_ROOT' || true)"
CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="${ROOT_OVERRIDE:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}"

# A gate met inside a /start lifecycle is resolved there: the lifecycle's

if [ "$WF_TYPE" = start ]; then
  echo "→ Gate cleared. Resume the lifecycle with /${PERSONA}:start (\$${PERSONA}:start on Codex); its refine phase fixes the finding." >&2
  exit 0
fi
```

**Defer.** Clear the gate with the deferral and `commit` as the next step
(`/engineer:commit` commits the change, or closes the workflow when there is
none), then end the verb:

```bash
TEXT_DIR='<directory from step 1>'
ROOT_OVERRIDE="$(printenv 'AGENTIC_ENGINEER_ROOT' || true)"

`awaiting-owner-clear` records `### Owner gate resolved: recurring-finding at
<iso>` with the pointer it cleared and the resolution, and replaces the gate's
next action. It refuses, writing
nothing, when the gate set on the workflow is not `recurring-finding`.
It refuses under an autopilot run too: only the owner resolves an owner gate.

## Multi-axis lens at a 2+-branch point (ADR-0029 §2)

If executing this verb surfaces a **genuine 2+-branch decision point**
— two viable fix strategies, or two refactor paths, or a non-neutral
`selected_next` with 2+ candidates in the proposal below — surface a
**compact multi-axis lens** comparing the branches across the resolved
decisive axes (본질/근본 essence/foundation) + supporting axes, instead
of a flat list. Resolve the sized axis set from the shared
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/decide-registry.mjs resolve --size=<minor|standard|major>`
resolver — the single axis source of truth, not a hand-authored list —
per `core/skills/_shared/references/entry-routing-contract.md`
§ "Surfacing the multi-axis lens from a non-decide verb".

Bounded: only at a genuine 2+-branch point (not every invocation),
default `--size=minor` (compact 4-axis), escalating only for weightier
branches — never the full 9-axis matrix for a trivial reversible step.
The full mechanism + the Codex path-resolution fallback live in
the contract subsection cited above.

---

## Completion

Output the change summary and one of:

- `✓ Refinement complete.` + edited files + verification status.
- `✓ Refinement blocked (peer flagged regression).` — when CONFLICT
  or significant peer concerns surfaced. Surface the issues; pause
  for user direction before retrying.
- `✓ Refinement complete (deeper root cause suspected).` — the fix did
  not hold or the symptom recurred.

Then emit the **Active Next-Action Proposal** the phase note above carries
(per `core/skills/_shared/references/entry-routing-contract.md`
§ Active Next-Action Proposal), instead of a fixed next verb.

Typical `selected_next` candidates for refine:
`/engineer:critique` to confirm with another review pass, or `commit` when
the change is small and verified — or `/engineer:investigate
--profile=root-cause` when a deeper root cause is suspected. The routing
table is the fallback only when evidence is genuinely neutral — do not end
with a hardcoded "next: X". When `selected_next` is `engineer:decide`, also
name the decision size (`--size=minor|standard|major`) per the contract.
The `blocked` case pauses for user direction before any forward proposal.

Always include the workflow path:

```
Workflow: <absolute path to workflow .md file>
```

<!-- pipeline:begin refine-completion-footer -->
The runtime completion footer is **code-emitted** on this verb's terminal
path (ADR-0039): the terminal write (`state.mjs finish-verb`, which takes
`set-terminal`'s path) fires the ADR-0031 session-handoff sidecar, which
shells out to the runtime `footer.mjs` and prints the rendered footer —
context state, completion state
(`blocked`, with the commit as its unblocking action, when only the commit
remains) + state-derived next action,
workflow id/path, artifact pointers, recommended next work, and the
continue-vs-fresh session-handoff — on that command's **stderr**.
Do **not** hand-compose a second footer; surface the one the terminal
command already emitted. The footer is advisory + pointer-only and
fail-closed (a missing/too-old runtime emits nothing, and the SessionStart
backstop still re-surfaces the handoff); it never mutates host session
context. On a detached HEAD the branch-based preflight reports "no active
branch context" and never recommends a fresh session (ADR-0018 §sub-2); the
path-targeted terminal sidecar renders the footer as on a branch, its
continue-vs-fresh advice included.
Under an autopilot run `finish-verb` makes no terminal write, so no footer is
printed: the driver is the handoff.
Wiring details:
`core/skills/_shared/references/session-handoff.md`.
