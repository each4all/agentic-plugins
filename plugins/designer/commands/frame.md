# Designer · Frame

$ARGUMENTS

Maintain one progress entry per phase and advance its status as you go
— use the host's task-tracking tools when the session exposes them,
and keep an inline checklist when it does not. The peer ensemble runs automatically (Frame point type) — never
ask the user whether to invoke the peer, and never direct them to run
companion CLIs manually. When the companions plugin or peer CLI is
unavailable, the ensemble degrades silently to local-only.

<!-- pipeline:begin plugin-root -->
Plugin root: each shell block below opens by setting `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` —
from `AGENTIC_DESIGNER_ROOT` when that is set, else from the plugin path
Claude Code writes into this command when it loads it, else from the newest
version in the plugin cache. Keep those opening lines when you run a block: a
shell variable does not outlive a Bash call.
<!-- pipeline:end plugin-root -->

> **designer is not an orchestrator dispatch target** (ADR-0042 Non-Goal
> 2): this command does NOT read `AGENTIC_PARENT_WORKFLOW` /
> `AGENTIC_ORIGINATING_SUBTASK`, and designer `state.mjs create` does not
> accept parent-linkage flags. designer workflows are user-invoked and
> branch-anchored only.

designer anchors to the frontend/design project git repository
(ADR-0042). If `git rev-parse` fails, refuse with manual-init guidance
(git init, or cd into your frontend/design project repo).

Empty `$ACTIVE` → bootstrap a new workflow with verb=frame:

<!-- pipeline:begin frame-bootstrap -->
The request reaches `state.mjs` as a file, never in the block: in shell
source a quote, `$`, backtick or line break of it would be read as code
(ADR-0059, amendment of 2026-10-10). Before the block:

1. Create a private directory for it, and note the path it prints:

   ```bash
   mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/agentic-text.XXXXXX"
   ```

2. With your file-writing tool, not the shell, create `request.txt` in that
   directory holding a one-line genericized design/UX topic, ending with one newline.
   Nothing deletes it.

Then run the block with `TEXT_DIR` set to that directory; a request file left
unwritten stops it before any write. When `AGENTIC_TOPIC` is set (a dispatched
run), the block writes it to a file of its own and records that instead, and
steps 1–2 are not needed.

```bash
TEXT_DIR='<directory from step 1>'

CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="${ROOT_OVERRIDE:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}"
[ -n "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT" ] || CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="$(find ~/.claude/plugins/cache/agentic-plugins/'designer' -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d 2>/dev/null | grep -E '/(0|[1-9][0-9]*)\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)(\+[0-9A-Za-z-]+(\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)*)?$' | sort -V | tail -1)"

<!-- pipeline:end frame-bootstrap -->

Non-empty `$ACTIVE` → append-on-resume:

<!-- pipeline:begin frame-resume -->
```bash

CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="${ROOT_OVERRIDE:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}"

  --phase-note "Resumed from prior verb." \
  --current-phase phase-0-resume \
  --clear-next-step true \
  --next-action "Run ${VERB} skill" --event resumed || exit $?
```
<!-- pipeline:end frame-resume -->

`state.mjs` enforces the directory-level lock + per-file lock with
ownership token + stale window per ADR-0011 §3, and writes only persona
`designer` (canonical-home guard).

---

## Phase 1 — Execute frame

Follow the frame skill's command-invoked mode at
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/core/skills/frame/SKILL.md`. The skill articulates the UX
problem model: user problem/opportunity, users + job-to-be-done, design
goals, MEASURABLE UX success metrics, constraints, key risks,
out-of-scope items.

Frame is single-mode (no `--profile` argument). Design context flows
through the Design Task Profile (canonically defined in the shared
`core/skills/_shared/references/orchestration.md` reference, restated inline in
the investigate skill).

### Privacy gate (before any external call)

<!-- pipeline:begin frame-privacy-gate -->
PRIVACY GATE: proprietary UI, unreleased features/flows, customer data visible in screenshots, and secret-bearing frontend code
pass an explicit privacy gate before BOTH web search AND peer-host dispatch.
Genericize before the peer prompt; the pre-genericization value MUST never leave the local host.
See `core/skills/investigate/references/design-brief-spec.md` § Privacy Gate.
<!-- pipeline:end frame-privacy-gate -->

<!-- pipeline:begin frame-privacy-no-image -->
No dispatch passes `--image`: the companion peer path has no image channel, so
an image never reaches the peer as bytes.
<!-- pipeline:end frame-privacy-no-image -->

**Screenshots are sensitive by default** and are never sent to the peer as
bytes (the peer path is code/text-based; vision critique is a same-host
`designer:critique` capability).

### Ensemble dispatch (Frame point type)

Build the Frame prompt and write it as the block's `prompt.xml` (the steps
below), then dispatch in the background. The prompt template + synthesis contract live in
`core/skills/frame/SKILL.md` § Step 3 (and
`core/skills/_shared/references/ensemble-protocol.md` §Frame):

<!-- pipeline:begin frame-dispatch -->
The prompt reaches the runner as a file the block never builds: it carries the
artifact and the peer's instructions, and in shell source a quote, `$`,
backtick or line of them would be read as code (ADR-0059, amendment of
2026-10-10). Before the block:

1. Create a private directory for it, and note the path it prints:

   ```bash
   mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/agentic-text.XXXXXX"
   ```

2. With your file-writing tool, not the shell, create `prompt.xml` in that
   directory holding the prompt (where this runbook has a privacy gate above,
   it must have passed, and the prompt carries only genericized text).
   Nothing deletes it.

Then run the block with `TEXT_DIR` set to that directory; a prompt left
unwritten stops it before the dispatch.

```bash
TEXT_DIR='<directory from step 1>'
ROOT_OVERRIDE="$(printenv 'AGENTIC_DESIGNER_ROOT' || true)"
CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="${ROOT_OVERRIDE:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}"
[ -n "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT" ] || CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="$(find ~/.claude/plugins/cache/agentic-plugins/'designer' -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d 2>/dev/null | grep -E '/(0|[1-9][0-9]*)\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)(\+[0-9A-Za-z-]+(\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)*)?$' | sort -V | tail -1)"
ENSEMBLE_TYPE='frame'
# The prompt the agent wrote with its file tool: the runner reads it, so no
# line of it is shell source. A prompt left unwritten stops the block here.
PROMPT_FILE="$TEXT_DIR/prompt.xml"
grep -q '[^[:space:]]' "$PROMPT_FILE" 2>/dev/null || { echo "✗ prompt.xml in TEXT_DIR ($TEXT_DIR) is missing or blank; write it with the file tool first. Nothing was dispatched." >&2; exit 1; }
# ADR-0017 §sub-decision 4 — stable run-id BEFORE dispatch.
RUN_ID="${ENSEMBLE_TYPE}-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)-$(printf '%06x' $((RANDOM*RANDOM & 0xffffff)))"
# Run this block as a host background task (on Claude, the Bash tool's
# run_in_background), never with a trailing `&`: the host tracks the runner
# and notifies you when it exits, where a shell `&` would detach it from both.
node "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/peer-runner.mjs" run \
  --repo-root "$REPO_ROOT" --kind ensemble \
  --peer codex --prompt-file "$PROMPT_FILE" --output-format json \
  --workflow-path "$ACTIVE" --phase 'frame' \
  --host "${AGENTIC_HOST:-claude}" --cwd "$REPO_ROOT" \
  --ensemble-type "$ENSEMBLE_TYPE" --run-id "$RUN_ID" \
  > "$PROMPT_FILE.run.json" 2> "$PROMPT_FILE.err"
```
<!-- pipeline:end frame-dispatch -->

Use `run_in_background: true` on the Bash tool. `peer-runner.mjs run`
records the matching `pending_ensemble` row before spawning the companion
and writes raw peer output under the hidden peer-run ledger. Synthesize per
the AGREED / LOCAL-ONLY / PEER-ONLY / CONFLICT base categories.

Graceful degradation: companion missing or exit code 3
(`peer_cli_not_found` / `peer_unauthenticated` / `peer_invocation_error`)
→ proceed local-only and record "### Ensemble degraded:" in the body.

---

## Phase 2 — State finalize

<!-- pipeline:begin frame-finalize -->
The phase note this step records — fill in every `<…>`. When no run launched
(the privacy gate kept the verb local-only, so no dispatch ran; a run whose
companion is missing did launch, and settles `failed`), its first heading reads
`### Ensemble skipped: frame (privacy gate)` instead, and the synthesis
is local-only:

```markdown
### Ensemble launched: frame at <iso-utc>

### Ensemble synthesis: frame verdict=<agreed|concerns|conflict>

<AGREED / LOCAL-ONLY / PEER-ONLY / CONFLICT breakdown>

### UX problem model

UX Problem / Opportunity: ...
Users + Job-to-be-Done: ...
Goals: ...
Measurable UX success metrics: ...
Constraints: ...
Key risks: ...
Out of scope: ...

### Active next-action proposal

(per `core/skills/_shared/references/entry-routing-contract.md` § Active Next-Action Proposal — derived from this artifact, not a fixed table)
- selected_next:         <verb | commit | done | owner decision>
- rejected_alternatives: <1-2 alternatives, each + one-line why-not>
- rationale:             <why best — 본질/근본 (essence/foundation) + evidence-quality gate>
- evidence_pointers:     <UX-problem-model fields / brief path — pointers only>
- confidence:            <HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW>
- next_command:          <exact next step: /designer:<verb> … or $designer:<verb> for a verb; the owner's save and commit for commit; none for done; the owner's decision otherwise>
```

The note, and the two texts the block records with it, reach the scripts as
files, never in the block: in shell source a quote, `$`, backtick or line of
them would be read as code (ADR-0059, amendment of 2026-10-10). Before the
block:

1. Create a private directory for them, and note the path it prints:

   ```bash
   mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/agentic-text.XXXXXX"
   ```

2. With your file-writing tool, not the shell, create in that directory
   `note.md`, the phase note above filled in; `summary.txt`, a one-line
   résumé of its breakdown; and `next-action.txt`, the next action the
   `append` and the last write record: the compact form of the proposal
   (selected_next + one-line why + next_command). The typical-case default
   is

   ```text
   Decide on a design direction given this frame (/designer:decide)
   ```

   Write another when the verb's result selects a different next step, and
   for an owner gate below `Owner: ` and the judgment in a few words. Each
   file holds its text as written and ends with one newline, which the
   scripts remove; nothing deletes the files.

Then run the block with `TEXT_DIR` set to that directory, `RUN_ID` to the run
id the dispatch generated (empty when no run launched), and `VERDICT` to the
synthesis's verdict. A file left unwritten, blank, or not UTF-8 text stops the
block before any write.

`peer-runner.mjs settle` decides from the run ledger what the workflow
records, not from these values alone: a run that never launched records
nothing; a run that launched and failed, was cancelled or was abandoned
records verdict `failed` with the ledger's `error_kind`; a run that completed
records the synthesis verdict, or `degraded` when its answer was empty or
unreadable. An answer that parses to nothing usable, only structural
shell, reads to `settle` like any other, so set `VERDICT` to `degraded` then.
It refuses, and the block stops before the last write, while a run is still
live (collect it first) or when an empty `RUN_ID` would hide a run that
launched (set it to that run's id).

The last write, `finish-verb`, records the proposal's next step in closed-enum
form: `--next-step-kind` `verb` (with `--next-step-verb`), `commit` (the owner
saves and commits the artifact; designer runs no commit itself) or `done`,
each closing the workflow `summary-complete`. End instead with an owner gate
when the owner must judge, with the judgment under the gate's heading in the
note:

- `scope-routing` (heading `### Routing recommendation`, anchor
  `routing-recommendation`): the request does not belong in this verb or
  workflow; the owner picks the route, then clears the gate.

The owner-decision form below records the gate with the next step in one
write and leaves the workflow open, not terminal, until the owner resolves it.

```bash

## Multi-axis lens at a 2+-branch point (ADR-0029 §2)

If executing this verb surfaces a **genuine 2+-branch decision point** —
two viable UX problem framings, or two candidate user segments / primary
jobs — surface a **compact multi-axis lens** across the decisive design
axes (usability 사용성 + the context lens the question turns on, with
accessibility 접근성 as the veto gate, per ADR-0042 SD3) +
size-appropriate supporting axes, instead of a flat list. The designer
decision registry (`core/skills/decide/references/decision-axes.yml`) is the
axis source of truth; when it is unreachable, read the decisive axes
inline as above. Bounded: only at a genuine 2+-branch point.

---

## Completion

Output the synthesized UX problem model and one of:

- `✓ Frame complete.` — typical case.
- `✓ Frame complete (ambiguous boundary).` — when CONFLICT appeared in the
  UX problem or user-segment between local and peer. Surface the ambiguity
  and pause for reconciliation before downstream verbs.

Then emit an **Active Next-Action Proposal** (the inline shape shown in
`core/skills/frame/SKILL.md` § Completion): typical `selected_next` candidates
are `/designer:decide` when 2+ directions need comparison (name the size
`--size=minor|standard|major`), or `/designer:compose` when the direction
is already obvious. Do not end with a hardcoded "next: X".

ADR-0042 is `Accepted` — the full designer surface (the six verbs, the
`/designer:start` lifecycle macro, and the `resume` / `checkpoint` /
`peer-now` meta skills) ships, so every `next_command` is runnable. The UX problem model is the durable
handoff. See `core/skills/frame/SKILL.md` § Completion.

Always include the workflow path:

```
Workflow: <absolute path to workflow .md file>
```

<!-- pipeline:begin frame-completion-footer -->
The runtime completion footer is **code-emitted** on this verb's terminal
path (ADR-0039): the terminal write (`state.mjs finish-verb`, which takes
`set-terminal`'s path) fires the ADR-0031 session-handoff sidecar, which
shells out to the runtime `footer.mjs` and prints the rendered footer —
context state, completion state
(designer's manually-published mapping surfaces `publish-needed` when
only the owner's save/commit remains) + state-derived next action,
workflow id/path, artifact pointers, recommended next work, and the
continue-vs-fresh session-handoff — on that command's **stderr**.
Do **not** hand-compose a second footer; surface the one the terminal
command already emitted. The footer is advisory + pointer-only and
fail-closed (a missing/too-old runtime emits nothing, and the SessionStart
backstop still re-surfaces the handoff); it never mutates host session
context. On a detached HEAD the branch-based preflight reports "no active
branch context" and never recommends a fresh session (ADR-0018 §sub-2); the
path-targeted terminal sidecar renders the footer as on a branch, its
continue-vs-fresh advice included.
Wiring details:
`core/skills/_shared/references/session-handoff.md`.
