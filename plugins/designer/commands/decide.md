# Designer · Decide

$ARGUMENTS

Maintain one progress entry per phase and advance its status as you go — use the host's task-tracking tools when the session exposes them, and keep an inline checklist when it does not. The peer ensemble
runs automatically (Brainstorm point type) — never ask the user whether to
invoke the peer, and never direct them to run companion CLIs manually. When
the companions plugin or peer CLI is unavailable, the ensemble degrades
silently to local-only.

<!-- pipeline:begin plugin-root -->
Plugin root: each shell block below opens by setting `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` —
from `AGENTIC_DESIGNER_ROOT` when that is set, else from the plugin path
Claude Code writes into this command when it loads it, else from the newest
version in the plugin cache. Keep those opening lines when you run a block: a
shell variable does not outlive a Bash call.
<!-- pipeline:end plugin-root -->

> **designer is not an orchestrator dispatch target** (ADR-0042 Non-Goal
> 2): this command does NOT read `AGENTIC_PARENT_WORKFLOW` /
> `AGENTIC_ORIGINATING_SUBTASK`, and designer `state.mjs create` does not
> accept parent-linkage flags. designer workflows are user-invoked and
> branch-anchored only.

## Phase 0 — Workflow continuity (per ADR-0011 §5)

<!-- pipeline:begin decide-phase-0 -->

  echo "  Switch to a branch first: git switch <branch>" >&2
  exit 1
fi
ACTIVE="$(node "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/state.mjs" \

FIND_RC=$?
if [ "$FIND_RC" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "✗ find-active failed (exit $FIND_RC); its error is above." >&2
  exit "$FIND_RC"
fi
```
<!-- pipeline:end decide-phase-0 -->

Empty `$ACTIVE` → bootstrap with verb=decide (single-mode — no `--profile`):

<!-- pipeline:begin decide-bootstrap -->
In the block, replace `<the original request described above>` with a
one-line genericized design decision; `AGENTIC_TOPIC` takes its place when it is set.

```bash

```
<!-- pipeline:end decide-bootstrap -->

Non-empty `$ACTIVE` → append-on-resume:

<!-- pipeline:begin decide-resume -->
```bash
ROOT_OVERRIDE="$(printenv 'AGENTIC_DESIGNER_ROOT' || true)"
CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="${ROOT_OVERRIDE:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}"
[ -n "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT" ] || CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="$(find ~/.claude/plugins/cache/agentic-plugins/'designer' -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d 2>/dev/null | grep -E '/(0|[1-9][0-9]*)\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)(\+[0-9A-Za-z-]+(\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)*)?$' | sort -V | tail -1)"
VERB='decide'
node "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/state.mjs" append \
  --workflow-path "$ACTIVE" --host "${AGENTIC_HOST:-claude}" --verb 'decide' \
  --phase-label "Phase 0: Resume into ${VERB}" \
  --phase-note "Resumed from prior verb." \
  --current-phase phase-0-resume \
  --next-action "Run ${VERB} skill" --event resumed || exit $?
```
<!-- pipeline:end decide-resume -->

`state.mjs` enforces the directory-level lock + per-file lock with
ownership token + stale window per ADR-0011 §3, and writes only persona
`designer` (canonical-home guard).

---

## Phase 0.5 — Resolve design decision axes from the registry (ADR-0042 SD3 / ADR-0027 §5.6)

<!-- pipeline:begin decide-resolve -->
Parse the arguments into flags + body and resolve the preset from
`core/skills/decide/references/decision-axes.yml`. The block prints the
resulting `ResolvedDecisionContext` JSON on stdout, and the skill body reads
it from that output. Nothing is written to disk: the context stays in the
session for the duration of the command (ADR-0027 §4.3), and no later Bash
call has to find a file whose path lived only in an earlier call's shell.

The CLI reuses `scripts/lib/decide-args.mjs` internally so the same flag
grammar applies: unknown flags, invalid `--size=<tier>` values, or
malformed `--weights=<spec>` (non-numeric/negative/exponent weight,
uppercase or duplicate axis-id, empty spec, whitespace) produce a parser
error and exit 2 (we halt). `--preset=<id>` is passed through by the parser
(not shape-validated there) and semantically resolved by the registry per
ADR-0027 §1.6 graceful-degradation — an unknown preset id triggers
`context.registry_fallback = true` + fall-back to the
`balanced` preset with a diagnostic (no halt), while an empty one
counts as no `--preset` at all. The body — everything after the flags, byte
for byte — is threaded into `context.body`.

The arguments above reach the resolver through an args file, never
through the shell (ADR-0059): typed text spliced into a command line is cut
at `;`, expanded at `$(…)` and redirected at `>`, and the damage can exit
zero. Before the block below:

1. Create a private directory for the file, and note the path it prints:

   ```bash
   mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/agentic-args.XXXXXX"
   ```

2. With your file-writing tool, not the shell, create `args.json` in that
   directory holding `{"agentic_args": 1, "text": "…"}`, with `text` set to
   the arguments above exactly as typed, as a JSON string (`""` when there
   are none).

Then run the block with `ARGS_DIR` set to that directory. The resolver reads
leading `--key=value` flags and takes the rest, byte for byte, as the
decision body — a lone `--` ends the flags, and nothing in the body is
quoted, expanded or split. The command removes the args file and its
directory once it has read them.

```bash
ARGS_DIR='<directory from step 1>'
ROOT_OVERRIDE="$(printenv 'AGENTIC_DESIGNER_ROOT' || true)"
CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="${ROOT_OVERRIDE:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}"
[ -n "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT" ] || CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="$(find ~/.claude/plugins/cache/agentic-plugins/'designer' -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d 2>/dev/null | grep -E '/(0|[1-9][0-9]*)\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)(\+[0-9A-Za-z-]+(\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)*)?$' | sort -V | tail -1)"
# stdout: the ResolvedDecisionContext JSON. stderr: the resolver's warnings
# and diagnostics, shown as they are written.
node "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/decide-registry.mjs" resolve --args-file "$ARGS_DIR/args.json"
RESOLVE_RC=$?

if [ "$RESOLVE_RC" -eq 2 ]; then
  echo "✗ decide-registry rejected the argument list — fix the invocation and rerun." >&2
  exit 1
elif [ "$RESOLVE_RC" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "✗ decide-registry failed with exit $RESOLVE_RC; see diagnostics above." >&2
  exit 1
fi
```
<!-- pipeline:end decide-resolve -->

The skill body reads the `ResolvedDecisionContext` Phase 0.5 printed to obtain:

- `axes[]` — ordered axis descriptors (id, en/ko labels, question, role,
  `gate`) for the resolved preset. `gate: true` marks the **veto gate**
  (접근성 Accessibility) — a hard candidate WCAG A/AA barrier vetoes the
  option regardless of the decisive axes (see `core/skills/decide/SKILL.md`
  @decide:recommendation-rule; candidate-level per ADR-0042 Non-Goal 6).
- `preset_id` — the active preset id (balanced | conversion | experience |
  clarity).
- `size` / `size_explicit` — the resolved ritual tier (minor | standard |
  major). When `--size` was not passed, `size` defaults to `"standard"`.
- `weights` — `Record<string, number>` from `--weights=<spec>`. Empty `{}`
  is the sentinel for "no `--weights` flag" (uniform 1.0 downstream).
- `weights_explicit` — boolean; `true` iff the user passed `--weights`.

If the file is missing or the JSON is unparseable, fall back to the in-code
default preset (the 7-axis `balanced` design matrix — 사용성 usability +
일관성 consistency decisive, 접근성 accessibility gate) — the registry is a
graceful-degradation artifact per ADR-0027 §1.6.

---

## Phase 1 — Execute decide

Follow the decide skill's command-invoked mode at
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/core/skills/decide/SKILL.md`. The skill performs 2+
design-direction generation, evidence-based comparison across **the axes
resolved in Phase 0.5** (usability / consistency /
conversion / desirability / content-clarity / feasibility, plus the
accessibility veto gate), and recommends a direction with explicit
rationale. The user makes the final call.

Decide is single-mode (no `--profile` argument). Design sub-discipline
context flows through the Design Task Profile per `core/skills/investigate/SKILL.md`
§ Design Task Profile (the shared `core/skills/_shared/references/orchestration.md`
reference).

### Privacy gate (before any external call)

PRIVACY GATE: proprietary UI, unreleased features/flows, customer data
visible in screenshots, and secret-bearing frontend code pass an explicit
privacy gate before BOTH web search AND peer-host dispatch. Genericize
before the peer prompt; the pre-genericization value MUST never leave the
local host. **Screenshots are sensitive by default** and are never sent to
the peer as bytes (the peer path is code/text-based; vision critique is a
same-host `designer:critique` capability). See
`core/skills/investigate/references/design-brief-spec.md` § Privacy Gate.

### Ensemble dispatch (Brainstorm point type)

Build the Brainstorm prompt (independent generation of 2-3 design
directions with tradeoffs across the resolved axes), write it to a
tempfile, and dispatch in the background. The prompt template (with the
`<axis_awareness>` design-axis block) + synthesis contract land in
`core/skills/_shared/references/ensemble-protocol.md` §Brainstorm; the
dispatch shape mirrors the reference-scan dispatch in
`core/skills/investigate/references/design-brief-ensemble.md`:

<!-- pipeline:begin decide-dispatch -->
```bash
ROOT_OVERRIDE="$(printenv 'AGENTIC_DESIGNER_ROOT' || true)"
CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="${ROOT_OVERRIDE:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}"
[ -n "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT" ] || CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="$(find ~/.claude/plugins/cache/agentic-plugins/'designer' -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d 2>/dev/null | grep -E '/(0|[1-9][0-9]*)\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)(\+[0-9A-Za-z-]+(\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)*)?$' | sort -V | tail -1)"
ENSEMBLE_TYPE='brainstorm'
PROMPT_FILE="$(mktemp -t 'designer'-'decide'-prompt.XXXXXX).xml"
# ADR-0017 §sub-decision 4 — stable run-id BEFORE dispatch.
RUN_ID="${ENSEMBLE_TYPE}-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)-$(printf '%06x' $((RANDOM*RANDOM & 0xffffff)))"
# ... LLM writes the prompt to $PROMPT_FILE (the privacy gate above must have
#     passed; the prompt carries only genericized text) ...
node "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/peer-runner.mjs" run \
  --repo-root "$REPO_ROOT" --kind ensemble \
  --peer codex --prompt-file "$PROMPT_FILE" --output-format json \
  --workflow-path "$ACTIVE" --phase 'decide' \
  --host "${AGENTIC_HOST:-claude}" --cwd "$REPO_ROOT" \
  --ensemble-type 'brainstorm' --run-id "$RUN_ID" \
  > "$PROMPT_FILE.run.json" 2> "$PROMPT_FILE.err" &
```
<!-- pipeline:end decide-dispatch -->

Use `run_in_background: true` on the Bash tool. `peer-runner.mjs run`
records the matching `pending_ensemble` row before spawning the companion
and writes raw peer output under the hidden peer-run ledger. Synthesize:
merge orchestrator + peer direction sets. PEER-ONLY directions → add.
AGREED → elevate confidence. CONFLICT → present both with evidence and ask
the user.

Graceful degradation: companion missing or exit code 3
(`peer_cli_not_found` / `peer_unauthenticated` / `peer_invocation_error`)
→ proceed local-only and record "### Ensemble degraded:" in the body.

---

## Phase 2 — State finalize

<!-- pipeline:begin decide-finalize -->
The phase note this step records — fill in every `<…>`:

```markdown
### Ensemble launched: decide at <iso-utc>

### Ensemble synthesis: decide verdict=<agreed|concerns|conflict>

<AGREED / LOCAL-ONLY / PEER-ONLY / CONFLICT breakdown>

### Directions compared

<table or list of directions with tradeoffs across the resolved design axes>

### Recommendation

<chosen direction + rationale + accessibility gate verdict + risks>

### Active next-action proposal

- selected_next:         <verb | owner decision>
- rejected_alternatives: <1-2 alternatives, each + one-line why-not>
- rationale:             <why best — decisive 사용성/archetype axis + the accessibility gate verdict>
- evidence_pointers:     <phase notes / brief / artifacts — pointers only>
- confidence:            <HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW>
- next_command:          <exact next step: /designer:<verb> … or $designer:<verb> for a verb>
```

Then run the block with the filled-in note in place of its placeholder line,
between the two `PHASE_NOTE` lines. The quoted heredoc hands the note to
`state.mjs` as written: no quote, `$`, backtick or backslash in it is read by
the shell. The first line that reads `PHASE_NOTE` alone ends the note, and
the shell runs every line after it as a command, so when the note itself holds
such a line, replace both `PHASE_NOTE` delimiters with a word no line of the
note consists of.

## Multi-axis lens at a 2+-branch point (ADR-0029 §2)

Decide IS the multi-axis verb — the comparison above already renders the
resolved axes. If a *sub-fork* surfaces mid-decision (e.g. two ways to
structure the same flow), keep the lens bounded to the decisive design axes
(사용성 + the archetype axis) + the accessibility gate rather than
re-running the full matrix.

---

## Completion

Output the comparison and one of:

- `✓ Decision recommended.` + chosen direction.
- `✓ Decision pending user input.` — when CONFLICT remained, or the
  accessibility veto gate is unresolved. Surface both options with
  evidence; pause until the user selects.

Then emit an **Active Next-Action Proposal** (the inline shape in
`core/skills/decide/SKILL.md` § Completion): typical `selected_next` is
`/designer:compose` to draft the flows/specs for the chosen direction — or
`/designer:investigate` if a decisive evidence gap (or an unresolved gate)
surfaced, or `/designer:frame` if deciding reframed the UX problem. Do not
end with a hardcoded "next: X".

ADR-0042 is `Accepted` — the full designer surface (the six verbs, the
`/designer:start` lifecycle macro, and the `resume` / `checkpoint` /
`peer-now` meta skills) ships, so every `next_command` is runnable. The decision record is the durable
handoff. See `core/skills/decide/SKILL.md` § Completion.

Always include the workflow path:

```
Workflow: <absolute path to workflow .md file>
```

<!-- pipeline:begin decide-completion-footer -->
The runtime completion footer is **code-emitted** on this verb's terminal
path (ADR-0039, enabled for designer by ADR-0043): `state.mjs
set-terminal` fires the ADR-0031 session-handoff sidecar, which shells out
to the runtime `footer.mjs` and prints the rendered footer — context
state, completion state (designer's manually-published mapping surfaces
`publish-needed` when only the owner's save/commit remains) + state-derived
next action, workflow id/path, artifact pointers, recommended next work,
and the continue-vs-fresh session-handoff — on that command's **stderr**.
Do **not** hand-compose a second footer; surface the one the terminal
command already emitted. The footer is advisory + pointer-only and
fail-closed (a missing/too-old runtime emits nothing, and the SessionStart
backstop still re-surfaces the handoff); it never mutates host session
context. Detached HEAD never auto-recommends a fresh session (ADR-0018
§sub-2; the branch-based preflight is what reports "no active branch
context" — the path-targeted terminal sidecar still renders normally).
Wiring details:
`core/skills/_shared/references/session-handoff.md`.
