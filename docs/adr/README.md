# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains the foundational architectural decisions for
agentic-plugins. Each ADR captures one decision with its context, the chosen
direction, and the consequences.

## Format

ADRs follow the standard 5-section format:

1. **Status** — `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Superseded by ADR-NNNN`, `Deprecated`
2. **Context** — Forces at play and why a decision is needed
3. **Decision** — What was decided
4. **Consequences** — What follows from the decision (positive, negative, neutral)
5. **Alternatives Considered** — What else was on the table and why rejected

See [`template.md`](template.md) for the canonical layout.

## File naming

`NNNN-<kebab-case-slug>.md` where `NNNN` is a zero-padded sequence
number starting at 0001. Numbers are never reused. To replace a
decision, write a new ADR with `Status: Accepted` that references the
old one, and change the old one's status to `Superseded by ADR-NNNN`.

## Process

1. Copy `template.md` to `NNNN-<slug>.md` (next number)
2. Status starts as `Proposed`
3. Discuss / iterate
4. Merge with `Status: Accepted`
5. To supersede: new ADR + update old ADR's status
